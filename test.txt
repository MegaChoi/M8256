Yes, it is generally safe to have a large buffer size, especially if you have 8GB of RAM. However, you should keep in mind that allocating large amounts of memory can cause performance issues or even crash your program if your system is running low on memory.
In general, you should choose a buffer size that balances between the memory usage and the I/O performance of your program. A larger buffer size can result in better I/O performance as it reduces the number of read/write operations required to process the entire file, but it may also consume more memory.
In the case of reading a 10MB file, a buffer size of 1MB is reasonable and should not cause any issues on a system with 8GB of RAM. However, if you are processing much larger files, you may want to experiment with different buffer sizes to find the optimal balance between memory usage and I/O performance.
